Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about. 
Ideas, language, even the phrase ‘each other’
doesn’t make any sense.
The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. 
Don’t go back to sleep. 
You must ask for what you really want.
Don’t go back to sleep. 
People are going back and forth across the doorsill
where the two worlds touch. 
The door is round and open.
Don’t go back to sleep. •Rumi•
